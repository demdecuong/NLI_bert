I have been married almost 15 years. We have two children, 11 and 8. My childhood was horrible, seven years of sexual, physical, and mental/emotional abuse followed by instability and low self esteem issues as a teen. My husband met me after I began dealing with my childhood and knew all about my issues. He knew what would end our marriage, yet he did it and lied about it multiple times. I was pregnant and did not leave. We tried to make it work. We had another child. We have been through MANY "situations" in our marriage and as parents. For the past 6-8 years we have just been living as parents. Not lovers. In the past I tried everything to make our marriage work. I finally decided to be done with it. Now he says he loves me and wants to make it work. But he is manipulative and can be so mean. He uses my children to cause me pain and stress. He knows that they are the only reason I stay. We are in counciling, but I really have no "love" feelings for him. I told him I want a divorce, but he won't give me one. He has said he will make my life miserable until the 18 months of separation are up and divorce is granted. Any advice? I'm ready to run away...
